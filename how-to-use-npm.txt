/*Lesson 2: Login

 Because this is just a tutorial adventure, remember, we're not
 *actually* creating an account anywhere.  However, when you run
 this in the Real World, it'll create a real account, with a page
 on npmjs.com and the ability to publish packages that real live
 humans can install and enjoy.

 To see who you're logged in as, run `npm whoami`

 To create your account, run `npm adduser`

  npm whoami
  npm adduser
      Username: liuning0820
      Password:
      Email: (this IS public) ning.liu4@hp.com
